# Financial-Data-Analysis
ASSET ALLOCATION AND PORTFOLIO ANALYSIS:

• In this project, instead of analyzing individual stocks, I will use python to perform portfolio analysis such as calculating portfolio returns, risk and Sharpe ratio. 

• A portfolio is a collection of financial investments such as stocks, fixed income securities (bonds), cash, mutual funds and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).
